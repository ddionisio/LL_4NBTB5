    "intro_dialog_1": "Multiple space blobs have pierced through our dimension!",
    "intro_dialog_2": "Emergency protocol initiated.",
    "intro_dialog_3": "We must banish them immediately before they fall down to Earth!",
    "intro_attack_1": "With our latest advancements in blobology, we will be deploying Attack Blobs.",
    "intro_attack_2": "These blobs must be made with the power of multiplication, and who better to do it than you!",
    "intro_attack_3": "Our intrepid hero, go forth, and use your mathematical might to banish these invading blobs for good!",
    "lesson1_intro_1": "Multiplying a number of two or more digits can be tricky, but there’s a special trick to make it easier!",
    "lesson1_intro_2": "Let’s take a quick look at a math concept that we will be using for this trick.",
    "lesson1_distribute_1": "By using the distributive property, we can split up the large number of an equation into smaller pieces.",
    "lesson1_area_1": "To help visualize this, we will consider these smaller pieces as chunks of a rectangle’s area.",
    "lesson1_area_2": "As you can see, the rectangle is split into two.",
    "lesson1_area_3": "Then we compute the area of those two rectangles.",
    "lesson1_area_4": "And finally, we add these two areas together to get the area of the whole rectangle.",
    "lesson1_connect_1": "Let’s give it a try. Connect these two blobs to initiate the attack!",
    "lesson1_attack_distribute_1": "Here we will be splitting the numbers up by multiples of 10’s.",
    "lesson1_attack_distribute_2": "Splitting up the numbers this way allows us to simply multiply single digit numbers, and just add the zeroes in the end.",
    "lesson1_attack_distribute_3": "Now click on the boxed number to split it!",
    "lesson1_attack_eval_1": "Here we will compute the product of each sub areas by using the numpad to type in the digits.",
    "lesson1_attack_eval_2": "Since we split them up nicely, we only ever have to worry about multiplying single digit numbers.",
    "lesson1_attack_eval_3": "Just remember to add the zero at the end for the number with the denomination of 10!",
    "lesson1_attack_eval_4": "Once you’re happy with the number, press the enter button.",
    "lesson1_attack_sums_1": "Finally, we add the numbers together to form the final product!",
    "lesson1_attack_sums_2": "Once again, use the numpad to compute each digit of the number.",
    "lesson1_end_1": "Excellent! As you can see, it’s much easier to solve an equation by splitting it up into smaller pieces.",
    "lesson1_end_2": "Now you are ready to banish the blobs!",
    "lesson4_intro_1": "Here we are at the final stage, with only a handful of blobs left to banish!",
    "lesson4_intro_2": "This time around, we will be multiplying double digit numbers.",
    "lesson4_area_1": "Just as we split the area up horizontally, we can also split it vertically.",
    "lesson4_connect_1": "Now why don’t you give it a try?",
    "lesson4_attack_distribute_1": "Just as you have done up to this point, simply click on the boxed numbers to split them.",
    "lesson4_attack_eval_dd_1": "This time around, you will be multiplying two double digit numbers.",
    "lesson4_attack_eval_dd_2": "Fortunately, they are both multiples of 10.",
    "lesson4_attack_eval_dd_3": "All you need to do is multiply the two non-zero digits, and put two zeroes at the end.",
    "lesson4_end_1": "Nice! Even with multiplying double digits, splitting them up allows you to solve them with ease!",
    "lesson4_end_2": "You will certainly have no problem dealing with the remaining blobs!",
    "bonusBlob_1": "Look, there’s an anomaly blob!",
    "bonusBlob_2": "Connecting with this blob will allow us to clear out the entire board, and give us a bonus score.",
    "bonusBlob_3": "Who knows what challenge awaits, so why not give it a try?",
    "bonusBlob_4": "However, you only have one shot. Do your best!",
    "bonus_distribute_mixup_1": "Looks like the numbers of each area are all mixed up!",
    "bonus_distribute_mixup_2": "Simply drag the numbers to their appropriate place, and once you are satisfied, press the PROCEED button.",
    "bonus_distribute_mixup_3": "Hint: If you look closely at the size of each rectangle, and its associated width, you will know where to put the numbers.",
    "bonus_partial_products_1": "Uh oh, some of the partial products are missing!",
    "bonus_partial_products_2": "Use the numpad to fill in the missing numbers, then press the left or right arrows to move to the next one.",
    "bonus_partial_products_3": "Once all the missing numbers are filled, press the ENTER button to proceed.",
    "bonus_partial_products_4": "Just remember how you split the numbers up into multiples of 10’s like before, and you should have no problem!",
    "congratulations": "CONGRATULATIONS!",
    "congrats_desc": "All the blobs have been banished for good! Earth is safe once more!",
    "thank_you_for_playing": "Thank you for playing!"
