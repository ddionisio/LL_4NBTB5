Multiple space blobs have pierced through the sky! Banish these threats with the power of mathematics before they wreak havoc!

Use the touchpad or mouse to drag and connect a blob to another. Once connected, you will go through the process of generating the product of the equation. If correct, an attack blob will appear to banish the paired blobs.

The game will display hints after failing one attack. These will show up during multiplication, and will give tips on how to tackle certain numbers.

After two failed consecutive attacks, a “digit destroyer” will be available to the players to remove non-zero digits on certain blobs.
